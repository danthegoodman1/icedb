# IceDB

A cloud-native JSON-first serverless analytical database designed for low cost and arbitrary read capacity while maintaining the benefits of columnar data formats. It leverages object storage, serverless compute, and serverless databases to provide an infinitely scalable data warehouse for JSON data in which you only pay for storage when idle. It is called “IceDB” because it is designed for cold-starts: Going from idle to high-performance querying in milliseconds.
