To keep the License simple:

Section 1: You may (not intended to be comprehensive):
a. Use this for personal projects
b. Use this within your company to power other products that are not directly exposing IceDB as the functionality (e.g. offering a serverless analytics service backed by IceDB)
c. Use this in commercial and non commercial settings
d. Fork, clone, modify, and contribute!

Section 2: You may NOT (not comprehensive):
a. Sell hosted IceDB
b. Sell a thin layer over IceDB (e.g. offering a serverless analytics service backed by IceDB)
c. Clone IceDB without keeping open source and openly referencing IceDB as the parent

Omission from section 2 is not express or implicit permission. Use common sense. If you are unsure, please reach out! Section 1 is also not comprehensive, there are likely more instances where IceDB would be well used.

Use common sense to determine if your use case is considered permitted and/or ethical!

The maintainers of IceDB reserve all rights to modify the License.

Any jurisdiction, action, or proceedings arising under this license or IceDB will be settled exclusively in the courts of Delaware, USA.

By using IceDB, you agree to this license.
